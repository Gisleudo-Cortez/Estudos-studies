    "You've just learned about the design phase of the machine learning lifecycle. During the design phase, it is often wise to determine the added value of the project. This can serve as a justification and motivation for the project to move forward. In this exercise, you will determine the value of a potential project.\n",
    "You've just landed a job as a data scientist at a financial institution called MoneyCorp that aims to use machine learning to predict fraudulent transactions. At MoneyCorp, they get a transaction fee of 0.1% of the total transaction amount if that transaction is legal. If it is fraudulent, the money is lost, and it takes an agent from customer service time to undo the transaction, resulting in a cost of $5 per fraudulent transaction. Historically, MoneyCorp finds that they have 10,000 fraudulent transactions per month with a total transaction amount of $300,000. In recent literature, you find that you can expect to be able classify at least 70% of fraudulent transactions.\n",
