Semi join

Great job getting acquainted with semi joins and anti joins! You are now going to practice using semi joins.

Let's say you are interested in identifying languages spoken in the Middle East. The languages table contains information about languages and countries, but it does not tell you what region the countries belong to. You can build up a semi join by filtering the countries table by a particular region, and then using this to further filter the languages table.

You'll build up your semi join as you did in the video exercise, block by block, starting with a selection of countries from the countries table, and then leveraging a WHERE clause to filter the languages table by this selection.
"""

# Instructions

"""
Select country code as a single field from the countries table, filtering for countries in the 'Middle East' region.
---

    Write a second query to SELECT the name of each unique language appearing in the languages table; do not use column aliases here.
    Order the result set by name in ascending order.
---
Create a semi join out of the two queries you've written, which filters unique languages returned in the first query for only those languages spoken in the 'Middle East'.
"""

# solution

-- Select country code for countries in the Middle East
SELECT code
FROM countries
WHERE region = 'Middle East';

#----------------------------------#

-- Select unique language names
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM languages
-- Order by the name of the language
ORDER by name;

#----------------------------------#

SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM languages
-- Add syntax to use bracketed subquery below as a filter
WHERE code IN
    (SELECT code
    FROM countries
    WHERE region = 'Middle East')
ORDER BY name;

#----------------------------------#

# Conclusion

"""
Well done writing your first subquery in the form of a semi join. Think of all the opportunities that open up when queries become building blocks of larger queries!
"""


# exercise 02

"""
Diagnosing problems using anti join

Nice work on semi joins! The anti join is a related and powerful joining tool. It can be particularly useful for identifying whether an incorrect number of records appears in a join.

Say you are interested in identifying currencies of Oceanian countries. You have written the following INNER JOIN, which returns 15 records. Now, you want to ensure that all Oceanian countries from the countries table are included in this result. You'll do this in the first step.

SELECT c1.code, name, basic_unit AS currency
FROM countries AS c1
INNER JOIN currencies AS c2
ON c1.code = c2.code
WHERE c1.continent = 'Oceania';

If there are any Oceanian countries excluded in this INNER JOIN, you want to return the names of these countries. You'll write an anti join to this in the second step!
"""

# Instructions

"""

    Begin by writing a query to return the code and name (in order, not aliased) for all countries in the continent of Oceania from the countries table.
    Observe the number of records returned and compare this with the provided INNER JOIN, which returns 15 records.
---
Now, build on your query to complete your anti join, by adding an additional filter to return every country code that is not included in the currencies table.
"""

# solution

-- Select code and name of countries from Oceania
SELECT code, name
FROM countries
WHERE continent = 'Oceania';

#----------------------------------#

SELECT code, name
FROM countries
WHERE continent = 'Oceania'
-- Filter for countries not included in the bracketed subquery
  AND code NOT IN
    (SELECT code
    FROM currencies);

#----------------------------------#

# Conclusion

"""
Nice! Your anti join determined which five out of 19 countries that were not included in the INNER JOIN provided. Did you notice that Tuvalu has two currencies, and therefore shows up twice in the INNER JOIN? This is why the INNER JOIN returned 15 rather than 14 results.

Subquery inside WHERE

The video pointed out that subqueries inside WHERE can either be from the same table or a different table. In this exercise, you will nest a subquery from the populations table inside another query from the same table, populations. Your goal is to figure out which countries had high average life expectancies in 2015.

You can use SQL to do calculations for you. Suppose you only want records from 2015 with life_expectancy above 1.15 * avg_life_expectancy. You could use the following SQL query.

SELECT *
FROM populations
WHERE life_expectancy > 1.15 * avg_life_expectancy
  AND year = 2015;

In the first step, you'll write a query to calculate a value for avg_life_expectancy. In the second step, you will nest this calculation into another query.
"""

# Instructions

"""

    Begin by calculating the average life expectancy from the populations table.
    Filter your answer to use records from 2015 only.
---
The answer from your query has now been nested into another query; use this calculation to filter populations for all records where life_expectancy is 1.15 times higher than average.
"""

# solution

-- Select average life_expectancy from the populations table
SELECT AVG(life_expectancy)
FROM populations
-- Filter for the year 2015
WHERE year = 2015;

#----------------------------------#

SELECT *
FROM populations
-- Filter for only those populations where life expectancy is 1.15 times higher than average
WHERE life_expectancy > 1.15 *
  (SELECT AVG(life_expectancy)
   FROM populations
   WHERE year = 2015) 
    AND year = 2015;

#----------------------------------#

# Conclusion

"""
Nice work! You may recognize many of these country codes as being relatively wealthy countries, which makes sense as we might expect life expectancy to be higher in wealthier nations.

WHERE do people live?

In this exercise, you will strengthen your knowledge of subquerying by identifying capital cities in order of largest to smallest population.

Alright! You've got plenty of practice on subqueries inside WHERE. Let's move on to subqueries inside the SELECT statement.

# exercise 05

"""
Subquery inside SELECT

As explored in the video, there are often multiple ways to produce the same result in SQL. You saw that subqueries can provide an alternative to joins to obtain the same result.

In this exercise, you'll go further in exploring how some queries can be written using either a join or a subquery.

In Step 1, you'll begin with a LEFT JOIN combined with a GROUP BY to select the nine countries with the most cities appearing in the cities table, along with the counts of these cities. In Step 2, you'll write a query that returns the same result as the join, but leveraging a nested query instead.
"""

# Instructions

"""

    Write a LEFT JOIN with countries on the left and the cities on the right, joining on country code.
    In the SELECT statement of your join, include country names as country, and count the cities in each country, aliased as cities_num.
    Sort by cities_num (descending), and country (ascending), limiting to the first nine records.
---

    Complete the subquery to return a result equivalent to your LEFT JOIN, counting all cities in the cities table as cities_num.
    Use the WHERE clause to enable the correct country codes to be matched in the cities and countries columns.

# solution

-- Find top nine countries with the most cities
SELECT countries.name AS country, COUNT(cities.name) AS cities_num
FROM countries
LEFT JOIN cities

Subquery inside FROM

Subqueries inside FROM can help select columns from multiple tables in a single query.

Subquery challenge

You are not interested in countries with "Republic" or "Monarchy" as their form of government, but are interested in all other forms of government, such as emirate federations, socialist states, and commonwealths.

You will use the field gov_form to filter for these two conditions, which represents a country's form of government. You can review the different entries for gov_form in the countries table.
