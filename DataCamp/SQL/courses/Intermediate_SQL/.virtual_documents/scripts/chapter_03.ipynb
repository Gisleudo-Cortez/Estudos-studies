Practice with aggregate functions

Now let's try extracting summary information from a table using these new aggregate functions. Summarizing is helpful in real life when extracting top-line details from your dataset. Perhaps you'd like to know how old the oldest film in the films table is, what the most expensive film is, or how many films you have listed.

Now it's your turn to get more insights about the films table!
"""

# Instructions

"""

    Use the SUM() function to calculate the total duration of all films and alias with total_duration.

    Calculate the average duration of all films and alias with average_duration.

    Find the most recent release_year in the films table, aliasing as latest_year.

    Find the duration of the shortest film and use the alias shortest_film.

-- Query the sum of film durations
SELECT SUM(duration) AS total_duration

Well done! You'll find yourself using aggregate functions over and over again to get a quick grasp of the data in a SQL database.

# exercise 02

"""
Combining aggregate functions with WHERE

When combining aggregate functions with WHERE, you get a powerful tool that allows you to get more granular with your insights, for example, to get the total budget of movies made from the year 2010 onwards.

This combination is useful when you only want to summarize a subset of your data. In your film-industry role, as an example, you may like to summarize each certification category to compare how they each perform or if one certification has a higher average budget than another.

Let's see what insights you can gain about the financials in the dataset.
    Use SUM() to calculate the total gross for all films made in the year 2000 or later, and use the alias total_gross.

2

    Calculate the average amount grossed by all films whose titles start with the letter 'A' and alias with avg_gross_A.

3

    Calculate the lowest gross film in 1994 and use the alias lowest_gross.

4

    Calculate the highest gross film between 2000 and 2012, inclusive, and use the alias highest_gross.

Using ROUND()

Aggregate functions work great with numerical values; however, these results can sometimes get unwieldy when dealing with long decimal values. Luckily, SQL provides you with the ROUND() function to tame these long decimals.

If asked to give the average budget of your films, ten decimal places is not necessary. Instead, you can round to two decimal places to create results that make more sense for currency.

Now you try!
"""

# Instructions

"""
Calculate the average facebook_likes to one decimal place and assign to the alias, avg_facebook_likes.
"""

# solution

-- Round the average number of facebook_likes to one decimal place
SELECT ROUND(AVG(facebook_likes),1) AS avg_facebook_likes
FROM reviews;

#----------------------------------#

# Conclusion

"""
Well done! The average, rounded facebook_likes is 7802.9. This insight can be used as a benchmark to measure film reviews; any film with over 7802.9 likes can be considered popular.
"""


# exercise 04

"""
ROUND() with a negative parameter

A useful thing you can do with ROUND() is have a negative number as the decimal place parameter. This can come in handy if your manager only needs to know the average number of facebook_likes to the hundreds since granularity below one hundred likes won't impact decision making.

Social media plays a significant role in determining success. If a movie trailer is posted and barely gets any likes, the movie itself may not be successful. Remember how 2020's "Sonic the Hedgehog" movie got a revamp after the public saw the trailer?

Let's apply this to other parts of the dataset and see what the benchmark is for movie budgets so, in the future, it's clear whether the film is above or below budget.
"""

# Instructions

"""
Calculate the average budget from the films table, aliased as avg_budget_thousands, and round to the nearest thousand.

ROUND() of applause! The ROUND() function is very handy when making financial calculations to get a top-level view or specify to the penny or cent.

# exercise 05

"""
Using arithmetic

SQL arithmetic comes in handy when your table is missing a metric you want to review. Suppose you have some data on movie ticket sales, but the table only has fields for ticket price and discount. In that case, you could combine these by subtracting the discount from the ticket price to get the amount the film-goer paid.

You have seen that SQL can act strangely when dividing integers. What is the result if you divide a discount of two dollars by the paid_price of ten dollars to get the discount percentage?

Correct! SQL thinks we want the answer to be an integer since we are dividing two integers. 0 is the closest integer to 0.2.

# exercise 06

"""
Aliasing with functions

Aliasing can be a lifesaver, especially as we start to do more complex SQL queries with multiple criteria. Aliases help you keep your code clean and readable. For example, if you want to find the MAX() value of several fields without aliasing, you'll end up with the result with several columns called max and no idea which is which. You can fix this with aliasing.

Now, it's over to you to clean up the following queries.
"""

# Instructions

"""

    Select the title and duration in hours for all films and alias as duration_hours; since the current durations are in minutes, you'll need to divide duration by 60.0.

    Calculate the percentage of people who are no longer alive and alias the result as percentage_dead.

    Find how many decades the films table covers by using MIN() and MAX() and alias as number_of_decades.

SELECT title, (duration / 60.0) AS duration_hours
