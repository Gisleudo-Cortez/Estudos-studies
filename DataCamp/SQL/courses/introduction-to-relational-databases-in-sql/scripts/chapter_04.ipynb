    "Good job! The professor with id 538 has the most affiliations in the \"Media & communication\" sector, and he or she lives in the city of Lausanne. Thanks to your database design, you can be sure that the data you've just queried is consistent. Of course, you could also put university_city and organization_sector in their own tables, making the data model even more formal. However, in database design, you have to strike a balance between modeling overhead, desired data consistency, and usability for queries like the one you've just wrote. Congratulations, you made it to the end!\n",
