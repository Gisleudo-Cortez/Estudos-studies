    "1. **Combining Tables by Rows (Union)**:\n",
    "   When you want to stack the rows of multiple tables on top of each other, you can use the `UNION` or `UNION ALL` operator. The difference between them is that `UNION` removes duplicate rows, while `UNION ALL` includes all rows, even if they are duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, if you have two tables with similar structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   -- Table 1: employees\n",
    "   employee_id | first_name | last_name | department\n",
    "   -------------------------------------------------\n",
    "   1           | John       | Doe       | HR\n",
    "   2           | Jane       | Smith     | IT\n",
    "\n",
    "   -- Table 2: contractors\n",
    "   contractor_id | first_name | last_name | project\n",
    "   -----------------------------------------------\n",

    "   102           | Lisa       | Brown     | Data Analysis\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can combine them using `UNION` like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, department, NULL AS contractor_id, NULL AS project\n",

    "   FROM contractors;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Combining Tables by Columns (Join)**:\n",
    "   When you want to combine data from multiple tables based on a common column or key, you can use `JOIN` clauses. There are different types of joins, such as `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN`, which control how the rows from both tables are matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, if you have two tables with a common column `department_id`:\n",

    "   ```sql\n",

    "   2           | Jane       | Smith     | 1002\n",
    "\n",
    "   -- Table 2: departments\n",
    "   department_id | department_name\n",
    "   ------------------------------\n",
    "   1001          | HR\n",
    "   1002          | IT\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can combine them using an `INNER JOIN` like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, department_name\n",
    "   FROM employees\n",
    "   INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The result will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "   employee_id | first_name | last_name | department_name\n",
    "   ------------------------------------------------------\n",

    "   2           | Jane       | Smith     | IT\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just basic examples, and you can perform more complex operations depending on your specific schema and requirements. Understanding the relationships between tables and the purpose of combining them will help you choose the appropriate method (Union or Join) and write effective SQL queries in PostgreSQL."

    "To extract data based on different conditions using PostgreSQL, you can use the `SELECT` statement along with various clauses like `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, and more. These clauses allow you to filter and retrieve specific data from the database that matches the given conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common examples of extracting data based on different conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Condition using WHERE**:\n",
    "   This is the most common way to extract data based on a specific condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "   FROM your_table_name\n",
    "   WHERE condition;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, if you have a table called \"employees\" and you want to retrieve all the employees whose department is \"HR\":\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name\n",
    "   FROM employees\n",
    "   WHERE department = 'HR';\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Conditions using AND and OR**:\n",
    "   You can combine multiple conditions using `AND` and `OR` operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "   FROM your_table_name\n",
    "   WHERE condition1 AND condition2;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, if you want to retrieve employees whose department is \"HR\" and their salary is greater than $50,000:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name\n",
    "   FROM employees\n",
    "   WHERE department = 'HR' AND salary > 50000;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Matching Values in a List using IN**:\n",
    "   You can use the `IN` operator to retrieve rows where a column's value matches any of the specified values in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "   FROM your_table_name\n",
    "   WHERE column1 IN (value1, value2, ...);\n",

    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name\n",
    "   FROM employees\n",
    "   WHERE department IN ('HR', 'IT', 'Marketing');\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Range of Values using BETWEEN**:\n",
    "   The `BETWEEN` operator allows you to retrieve rows where a column's value falls within a specified range.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "   FROM your_table_name\n",
    "   WHERE column1 BETWEEN value1 AND value2;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, to get employees whose salary is between $40,000 and $60,000:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name\n",
    "   FROM employees\n",
    "   WHERE salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 60000;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pattern Matching using LIKE**:\n",
    "   The `LIKE` operator allows you to retrieve rows where a column's value matches a specific pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "   FROM your_table_name\n",
    "   WHERE column1 LIKE 'pattern';\n",

    "   SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name\n",
    "   FROM employees\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Subquery in the FROM Clause**:\n",
    "   You can use a subquery in the `FROM` clause to create a derived table that acts as a temporary table for the main query.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, if you want to get the total number of employees in each department:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT department_id, department_name, total_employees\n",
    "   FROM (\n",

    "       FROM employees\n",
    "       GROUP BY department_id\n",
    "   ) AS employee_counts\n",
    "   JOIN departments ON departments.department_id = employee_counts.department_id;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, the subquery `(SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS total_employees FROM employees GROUP BY department_id)` calculates the total number of employees in each department, and the main query then joins this derived table with the \"departments\" table to get the department names.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subquery in the WHERE Clause**:\n",
    "   You can use a subquery in the `WHERE` clause to filter rows based on a condition from a different table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, if you want to retrieve employees who work in departments with more than 50 employees:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, department_id\n",
    "   FROM employees\n",
    "   WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM employees GROUP BY department_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 50);\n",
