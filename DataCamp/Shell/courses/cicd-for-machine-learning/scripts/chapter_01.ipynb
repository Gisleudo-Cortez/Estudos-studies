    "\n",

Indentation visually communicates the relationship between the course and its prerequisites, making the code easier to understand and maintain.\n",

    "By using block style for the array, you will also learn how each prerequisite is clearly separated. The block style allows for a clean representation of complex arrays, making it ideal for long or multiline content.
