    "Scientific notation is a powerful tool for representing numbers, but it can be confusing to handle when trying to print float values. However, we can use the f strings we learned about previously to make sure we get them printed properly every time by using a format specifier. For example, if we wanted to format a variable in an f string as a float, we can use the f format specifier, such as: print(f\"{some_variable:f}\"). It also takes an operation precision on the float format specifier, for example, print(f\"{some_variable:.4f}\") would print four decimal places of precision.\n",
