    "Similarly to what you did in Chapter 2, you are going to train a neural network. This time however, you will train the CNN you built in the previous lesson, instead of a fully connected network. The packages you need have been imported for you and the network (called net) instantiated. The cross-entropy loss function (called criterion) and the Adam optimizer (called optimizer) are also available. We have subsampled the training set so that the training goes faster, and you are going to use a single epoch.\n",

    "Building and training neural networks is a very exciting job (trust me, I do it every day)! However, the main utility of neural networks is to make predictions. This is the entire reason why the field of deep learning has bloomed in the last few years, as neural networks predictions are extremely accurate. On this exercise, we are going to use the convolutional neural network you already trained in order to make predictions on the MNIST dataset.\n",
