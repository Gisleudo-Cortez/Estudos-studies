    "Great! You can see that tuning multiple hyperparameters simultaneously achieves better results. In the previous exercise, tuning only the max_depth parameter gave the best RMSE of $6.50. With max_depth equal to 7 and subsample equal to 0.8, the best RMSE is now $6.16. However, do not spend too much time on the hyperparameter tuning at the beginning of the competition! Another approach that almost always improves your solution is model ensembling. Go on for it!\n",
