    "You've put it all together! Notice that the to_csv() method in the original class was using the original created_at attribute. After converting the attribute into a property, you could replace the call to self.created_at with the call to the internal attribute that's attached to the property, or you could keep it as self.created_at, in which case you'll now be accessing the property. Either way works!\n",
