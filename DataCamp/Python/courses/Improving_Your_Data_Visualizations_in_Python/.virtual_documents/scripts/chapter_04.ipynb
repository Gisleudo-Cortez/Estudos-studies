Loaded is a new dataset, markets.

In this exercise, explore the columns of the data to get familiar with them for future analysis and plotting.

As a first step, print out the first three lines of markets to get an idea of what type of data the columns encode. Then look at the summary descriptions of all of the columns. Since there are so many columns in the DataFrame, you'll want to turn the results 'sideways' by transposing the output to avoid cutting off rows.

Increasing the figure size with the figsize argument will help give the dense visualization some breathing room. Since there will be a lot of overlap for the points, decreasing the point opacity will help show the density of these overlaps.

You can show both the ratio and raw numbers by drawing two plots, one of the ratio and the other of the market number to population scatter plot.

Each row in the heatmap shows the distribution of the market "season" for a state and rows are sorted in descending order of the state's latitude.
